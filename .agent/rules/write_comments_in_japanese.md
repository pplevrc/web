# Write Comments in Japanese

## Language Requirement
- **strictly**: All comments, documentation, and JSDoc MUST be written in **Japanese**.
- **Reason**: The project maintainers are Japanese.

## Scope
- Inline comments (`// ...`)
- TSDoc / JSDoc (`/** ... */`)
- TODOs (`// TODO: ...`)
- Commit messages (optional but recommended for consistency)
